Years ago, **gamehackers.net** was home of **Team Limited Edition**, a community centered around Blizzard games like Diablo, Diablo II, Starcraft, and Warcraft III. We were a community passionate about modding/hacking these (and other) games, sharing tips and resources, and when we felt like it, even providing support for users who used our mods.

Today, users have tools like Cheat Engine, as well as various other memory editors and hex editors, but the community isn't the same. And the barrier to entry is higher than ever. There aren't great tutorials or resources on hacking or modifying games anymore.

I want to change that.

For a while, I've had this idea of creating a community for finding and sharing resources, whether it's in the form of written tutorials, videos, or git repositories allowing modders and game hackers the ability to show off their work, in a safe and legal way. While at the same time, preserving the history that lead us here; showcasing everything from chat bots to total conversion mods and everything in between.

Stay tuned.
